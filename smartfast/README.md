# SmartFast, an formal analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts
<img src="./logo.png" alt="Logo" align="left" width="300"/>

SmartFast is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It takes the Solidity source code of the smart contract as input, and expresses the source code as SmartIR (XML, IR, and IR-SSA) through a formal description. According to preset rules and taint tracking technology, SmartFast matches SmartIR to locate the contract code with vulnerabilities. In addition, SmartFast can also automatically Optimizationimize contract code and improve the userâ€™s understanding of the contracts.

## How to install

SmartFast requires Python 3.6+ and [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/) (solc-select), the Solidity compiler.

Before the analysis, we should install solc-select as fowllows. Note that solc-select can be replaced with other compiler, such as [solcx](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crytic/solc-select.git
./solc-select/scripts/install.sh
export PATH=$HOME/.solc-select:$PATH or put the command PATH=$HOME/.solc-select:$PATH into file "/etc/profile"
```

### Using Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmartContractTools/SmartFast.git && cd smartfast
python3 setup.py install
```

Of course, SmartFast can also be deployed in a virtual environment, which is one of the recommended ways. This project provides a virtual environment by default, under the venv folder. Execute the following command to start the virtual operating environment, and use SmartFast without installation.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
solc use 0.4.24
python -m smartfast.__main__ tests/arbitrary_send.sol
```

If you want to recreate the virtual environment, perform the following operations.

```bash
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.7 venv
venv/bin/python setup.py install
pip install jpype1
pip install reportlab
pip install crytic-compile==0.1.13
pip install prettytable
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install tqdm
pip install oscillo
```

Install the font for making report.

```bash
unzip font.zip
sudo cp font/* /usr/share/fonts/truetype/myfonts/
```

If you want to perform secondary development based on Smartfast, you can install the Java environment as follows.

```bash
dowload jdk-8u102-linux-x64.tar.gz from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html
tar -xvf jdk-8u102-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/local
vim /etc/profile
JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.8.0_102
CLASSPATH=.:$JAVA_HOME/lib.tools.jar
PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export JAVA_HOME CLASSPATH PATH
source /etc/profile	
java -version
```

### Using Docker

Use the `smartfast:v2` docker image. It includes all of our security tool and major version of Solidity. `/home/data` will be mounted to `/dataset` in the container.

```bash
docker pull scripthub/smartfast:v2
```

To share a directory in the container, which includes the contract datasets:

```
docker run -it -v /home/data:/dataset scripthub/smartfast:v2 /bin/bash
cd code/smartfast_code
source venv/bin/activate
solc use 0.4.24
python -m smartfast.__main__ tests/arbitrary_send.sol
```

## Publications

SmartFast holds most advantages of static analysis tools like Slither and SmartCheck. Also, in order to make SmartFast more functional and comprehensive, it combines some auxiliary functions of these tools. For instance, it can export the CFG of each functions based on Slither. More functions can be seen on [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation). Therefore, we appreciate these excellent functions provided by these tools.
